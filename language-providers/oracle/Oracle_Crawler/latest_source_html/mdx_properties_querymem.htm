In the first
approach, you can list the dimension and property combinations for each axis
set. When a query is executed, the specified property is evaluated for all
members from the specified dimension and included in the result set.</p><p>For example, on the column axis, the following query will return the
GEN_NUMBER information for every Market dimension member. On the row axis,
the query returns MEMBER_ALIAS information for every Product dimension member.</p><pre class="programlisting">SELECT
 [Market].Members
    DIMENSION PROPERTIES [Market].[GEN_NUMBER] on columns,
 Filter ([Product].Members, Sales &gt; 5000)
    DIMENSION PROPERTIES [Product].[MEMBER_ALIAS] on rows
from Sample.Basic</pre><p>When querying for member properties using the DIMENSION PROPERTIES section
of an axis, a property can be identified by the dimension name and the name
of the property, or just by using the property name itself. When a property
name is used by itself, that property information is returned for all members
from all dimensions on that axis, for which that property applies.</p><div class="note"><p class="admonTitle">Note:</p><p>When a property name is used
by itself within the DIMENSION PROPERTIES section, do not use brackets []
around the property name.</p></div><p>In the following query. the MEMBER_ALIAS property is evaluated on the
row axis for both Year and Product dimensions.</p><pre class="programlisting">SELECT
 [Market].Members
    DIMENSION PROPERTIES [Market].[GEN_NUMBER] on columns,
 CrossJoin([Product].Children, Year.Children)
    DIMENSION PROPERTIES MEMBER_ALIAS on rows
from Sample.Basic</pre><p>In a second approach, properties can be used inside value expressions
in an MDX query. For example you can filter a set based on a value expression
that uses properties of members in input set.</p><p>The following query returns all caffeinated products that are packaged
in cans.</p><pre class="programlisting">

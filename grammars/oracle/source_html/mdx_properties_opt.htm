calculated members, as well as the performance of queries that rely on them.</p><p>Optimization properties are applicable to outline members with formulas
and calculated members only. Stored members are not associated with these
properties.</p><p>The NONEMPTYMEMBER and NONEMPTYTUPLE properties enable MDX in Essbase to query on large sets of members or tuples while skipping
formula execution on non-contributing values that contain only #MISSING data.</p><p>Because large sets tend to be very sparse, only a few members contribute
to the input member (have non #MISSING values) and are returned. As a result,
the use of NONEMPTYMEMBER and NONEMPTYTUPLE in calculated members and formulas
conserves memory resources, allowing for better scalability, especially in
concurrent user environments.</p><p class="bridgehead"><a name="properties_techref_proj_maxl_dml_rules_d0e151"></a>NONEMPTYMEMBER</p><pre class="programlisting">NONEMPTYMEMBER <span class="italic">nonempty_member_list</span></pre><p>where <span class="italic">nonempty_member_list</span> is one
or more comma-separated member names or calculated member names from the same

the sum of Units (items per package) for the current month and the previous
two months, where Units data is not missing.</p><p>The calculated member [3 Month Units] calculates Units shipped for last
three months. If the units shipped for [MTD] (units shipped in a year) is
empty, it follows that Units data is empty for all months in the Year; therefore,
the sum of Units shipped for last three months is also empty. Because the
row axis in the query is very large and sparse, the NONEMPTYTUPLE property
would significantly increase the performance of the query in this case.</p><pre class="programlisting">WITH MEMBER [Measures].[3 Month Units] AS
